# Cat vs Dog Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

A deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images as either cats or dogs. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and trained on a dataset of cat and dog images.

## Dataset

The kaggle dataset used for training consists of a large number of cat and dog images. These images are labeled as either 'cat' or 'dog' and are used to teach the model to distinguish between the two classes.
