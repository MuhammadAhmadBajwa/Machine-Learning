# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This repository contains code for a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset contains the following classes:
- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

The images are labeled with one of these categories and serve as a benchmark for image classification algorithms.
